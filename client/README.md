# Super star

> Lee-Nation

Super star is a typical web application built on Nextjs and MDBReact with a musician in mind (my bosses favorite - DBanj) to consume a RESTful API. The musician or a logged admin to the website will be able to perform all the relevant CRUD operation relevant to the application in order to update the musicians Tours, Photo gallery , Video and music collections.
